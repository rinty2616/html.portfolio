<h1>The Best Series According to Rinty</h1>
<h2>My top 3 series all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Friends</h3>
<p>Friends is well known for its witty one-liners and hilarious jokes. 
    The show's timeless humor allows people of any age demographic to 
    relate to the characters and laugh at their jokes. Though it explores 
    issues of friendships,family, love, and heartbreaks, the soul of the 
    show lies in comedy.</p>
<h3>Virgin River</h3>
<p>Is Virgin River series worth watching?
    Virgin River truly is a great, relaxing show. But sometimes it can become
    a little stressful, with the plot twists and the crazy things that happen.
    All four seasons have these characteristics, but season 5 made all of them 
    bigger and better.</p>
<h3>Emily in Paris</h3>
<p>SUnderstandably so, because in a world of constant bad news and unprecedented 
    difficulties for the average working individual, Emily in Paris provides something
    that a lot of modern programming doesn't : cheeky, lighthearted plot lines with 
    reliable outcomes that make the viewer want to actually unwind as they watch./p>
